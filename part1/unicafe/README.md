# React + Vite

## Like most companies, the student restaurant of the University of Helsinki Unicafe collects feedback from its customers. 

- My task is to implement a web application for collecting customer feedback. There are only three options for feedback: good, neutral, and bad.

- The application must display the total number of collected feedback for each category. The application needs to work only during a single browser session. Once you refresh the page, the collected feedback is allowed to disappear.

- Expand the application so that it shows more statistics about the gathered feedback: the total number of collected feedback, the average score (good: 1, neutral: 0, bad: -1) and the percentage of positive feedback.

- Make the application to display statistics only once feedback has been gathered and display statistics in a table.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
